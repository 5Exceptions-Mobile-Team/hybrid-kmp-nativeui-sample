This project is a **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** module containing shared business logic and data models, designed to be used across Android, iOS, and other supported platforms.

## ðŸ§± Project Structure
```
shared/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ commonMain/          # Shared code across all platforms
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ commonTest/          # Shared tests
